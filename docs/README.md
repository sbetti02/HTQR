# HTQR
We are working to create a way for doctors to store and retrieve healthcare and patient information of refugees in refugee camps using a fingerpring scanner.

If a refugee were to move from one camp to another, we hope that this would help their healthcare information be shared automatically between doctors in refugee camps.  This way, the refugees would not have to repeatedly give their personal health information and potentially details on traumatizing events in their lives.

Once we have a database for this information and begin receiving data, we would like to compile healthcare statistics for refugees worldwide and on an area-by-area level as well.

We also want to use this data to create models or look for patterns, and be able to use that information to alert people to potential risks.  Our main focus in this aspect is human trafficking. One idea would be to use the data to try to determine particular individuals that may be more or less at risk, and have people in the camp be able to reach out to them and help them.
