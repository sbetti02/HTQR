Feature changes/additions
-------------------------

1. Take out unneeded fields on:
	- Patient: Anything identifying (Maybe just leave with site (gender and DOB maybe [maybe just DOB year? Unclear]))
	- Doctors: Do we need to remove any PII for them as well?
2. Assign each patient a random ID
	- Have that ID displayed in the main patient list
	- On creation, tell the doctor/admin what the ID is for the newly created patient and tell them to write it down
3. Figure out what to do with analytics
	- Just take out for now? Determine if they want this for the initial release
	- If leaving in, rework it since we won't be able to split by the same demographics we had before


Infrastructure upgrades for release
-----------------------------------

1. Move to a better tier on Heroku
	- Currently on the free tier, which is only really sufficient for testing
	- Get Mollica to pay for this instead of us


Misc
----

1. Confirm that the product we're building is actually legal if we're not holding PII,
   since we're still holding medical data


Technical debt
--------------

1. Build with Docker for making local development easier
2. Remove HTQ and co detail pages that are unused


Nice to haves
-------------
1. Set up google analytics
2. Use some sort of logging/visualizaiton set up
3. Add new tests for:
	a. Editing/deleting a patient
	b. Adding a patient to a new doctor list
	c. Removing a patient from a doctor's list
	d. Creating new diagnostic screenings
	e. Accessing the screenings via pdf
4. Migrate to AWS
5. Update Readme
6. Move JS code to the pages it's needed for (not needed/wanted in base.html)
