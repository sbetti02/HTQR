		<h1>DIAGNOSE and TREAT most patients</h1>

		<p>After a human-rights related trauma, almost everyone will experience some transient physical or psychological symptoms</p>

		<p>85% of patients will not suffer from serious mental illness and will benefit from your counseling on the nature of their symptoms and coping techniques</p>

		<p>15% will develop a specific psychiatric disorder including:
		<ul>
  		<li>grief reaction</li>
  		<li>generalized anxiety disorder</li>
  		<li>depression and PTSD</li>
  		<li>chronic insomnia</li>
		</ul></p>

		<p>Focus on treatment not only on diagnosis but on specific symptoms (e.g. insomnia).</p>

		<p>An integrated holistic approach can be very effective that uses counseling, medication, and traditional healing approaches. </p>

 		<p> <b>Never rely on only one treatment method.</b></p>

		<p><b>Always monitor the impact of your care on a timely basis.</b></p>

		<p>Depression and PTSD mask serious brain damage due to THI which will not respond to standard care.</p>

		<p>If a patient is not recovering always assess for traumatic head injury (THI).</p>

		<p>Use HPRTâ€™s screening instruments to help you decide if serious mental illness is present.</p>
